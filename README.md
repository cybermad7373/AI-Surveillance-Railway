# Railway AI Security  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The **Railway AI Security** project leverages artificial intelligence and real-time video analytics to enhance the safety, cleanliness, and operational efficiency of railway stations. The system is designed to address key challenges such as:  
- **Crowd Management**  
- **Cleanliness Monitoring**  
- **Crime Prevention**  
- **Workforce Efficiency Tracking**  

By combining advanced AI techniques with live camera feeds, this solution provides actionable insights for railway authorities to ensure a safe and comfortable passenger experience.
